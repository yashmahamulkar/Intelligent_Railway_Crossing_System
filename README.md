# Intelligent_Railway_Crossing_System

 Introduction:
An Intelligent Railway Crossing System is a technologically advanced system designed to improve the safety and efficiency of railway crossings. It uses a combination of sensors, and other advanced technologies to monitor  the movement of trains and vehicles at the crossing. The system can automatically detect the approach of trains, trigger alarms and signals, and control the flow of vehicular traffic to prevent accidents. The goal of this system is to improve the overall safety and reliability of railway crossings and reduce the risk of accidents.

Idea:
To alert pedestrians and/or animals crossing a railway track while a train is nearing at high speed using an automated system. The idea is to minimise the unnecessary casualties while crossing railway tracks.

Problem Solution:
Solution of our project is to save the lives of all living beings from accidents caused by being hit while crossing railway tracks by installing an automated system which would alert them.

Application flow:
The idea for our life-saving project is:
When a train approaches a railway station, at a certain distance from the station, the manually installed ultrasonic sensor detects the approaching train and an interrupt is sent to our controller circuit. Further, the controller circuit sends power to servo motors i.e. the flaps are lifted up and the tracks are safe for trains to pass. The lifted flaps block the way of every living being until the train passes by. Also, the controller circuit on detecting the train beeps an alarm so that crossers would know that the train is approaching. The flaps are again set on the tracks after some definite interval of time. The flaps are lightweight, hard, durable composite. The servo motors are supplied with just enough energy to lift the flap so that if a crosser is on the flap while an approaching train is detected, it would not feel any sudden jerks.
